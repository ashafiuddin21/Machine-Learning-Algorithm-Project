# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Project
A experiment of using ML algorithms to classify Big Data in the best way. 

As the final assignment for the Machine Learning Class I took in Seoul South Korea with Yonsei University, students were tasked with choosing any data that relates to their field of interest, and creating classifiers choosing any algorithms we have learned. This includes KNN, K-Means, SVM, Decision trees, Random forests, or Adaboost.
